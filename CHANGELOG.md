# Changelog

This project follows a pragmatic changelog format during early development.
Version numbers follow SemVer, but the public API is expected to change rapidly until `1.0`.

## Unreleased

- TBD

## 0.2.0

Highlights:
- Bugfix: code fence opening line no longer closes the fence immediately (thanks @omgpointless, #1).
- New: opt-in `sync` feature to require `Send + Sync` for `PendingTransformer` and `BoundaryPlugin`.
- New: `mdstream-tokio` crate (newline/time-window delta coalescing + an actor helper for owned `Update`s).
- New: `agent_tui` example (`cargo run -p mdstream-tokio --example agent_tui`) showing a Codex/Gemini-CLI style streaming UI:
  channel-fed updates, follow-tail, and pending code fence truncation to reduce flicker.
- Performance: borrowed update API (`append_ref` / `finalize_ref`) and faster pending code fence display updates for large blocks.
- Highlight: improved streaming smoothness for large code fences (fewer allocations + safer pending display).

## 0.1.0

Initial experimental release.

Highlights:
- Streaming-first block splitter: stable committed blocks + a single pending block.
- Pending terminator (Streamdown/remend-inspired) to reduce flicker from incomplete Markdown.
- Render-agnostic core designed for UI integrations (egui, gpui/Zed, TUI, etc.).
- Optional `pulldown-cmark` adapter (`pulldown` feature) with best-effort invalidation support.
- Custom boundary plugins (tag containers, `:::` containers) inspired by Streamdown + Incremark.
- Memory guardrail: optional buffer compaction via `Options.max_buffer_bytes`.
