# Changelog

This project follows a pragmatic changelog format during early development.
Version numbers follow SemVer, but the public API is expected to change rapidly until `1.0`.

## Unreleased

- TBD

## 0.1.0

Initial experimental release.

Highlights:
- Streaming-first block splitter: stable committed blocks + a single pending block.
- Pending terminator (Streamdown/remend-inspired) to reduce flicker from incomplete Markdown.
- Render-agnostic core designed for UI integrations (egui, gpui/Zed, TUI, etc.).
- Optional `pulldown-cmark` adapter (`pulldown` feature) with best-effort invalidation support.
- Custom boundary plugins (tag containers, `:::` containers) inspired by Streamdown + Incremark.
- Memory guardrail: optional buffer compaction via `Options.max_buffer_bytes`.
